Portugal Election Prediction Project
-----------------------------------------

Welcome to the Portugal Election Prediction repository! This project focuses on predicting the final number of elected MPs (Final Mandates) at both district and national levels during the 2019 Portuguese Parliamentary Elections. By leveraging real-time and historical election data, this project provides actionable insights for stakeholders such as political parties, analysts, and media.

📌 Objective
-----------------------------------------

The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately forecasts the final number of elected MPs (Final Mandates) using time-series election data updated every 5 minutes during the election period.

🌟 Specialties
-----------------------------------------

Domain: Election analytics, leveraging real-time election data.

Dataset: Time-series data of election results updated every 5 minutes over a span of 4 hours and 25 minutes.

Coverage: Captures results for 21 political parties across multiple districts and nationwide.

Historical Context: Includes both historical and real-time data, enabling comparisons with previous elections.

🔑 Key Variables
-----------------------------------------

Dynamic Election Data:

Real-time and cumulative metrics such as votes, mandates, and valid vote percentages.

Historical Comparison:

Pre-election metrics (e.g., votes, percentages) for trend analysis and benchmarking.

Territorial Context:

Covers district-level and national-level data for comprehensive insights.

Application:

Predictive analytics to inform stakeholders (political parties, analysts, or media) during live elections.

🛠️ Model Focus
-----------------------------------------

The project utilizes time-elapsed data and other statistical indicators to build an accurate predictive model. Key aspects include:

Time-series analysis to capture trends and patterns.

Statistical modeling to predict final mandates at district and national levels.

📊 Dataset
-----------------------------------------

The dataset includes:

Real-time election results updated every 5 minutes over 4 hours and 25 minutes.

Historical election data for comparison and trend analysis.

District-level and national-level data for 21 political parties.

🚀 Project Workflow
-----------------------------------------

Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and key features.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values and transforming time-series data.

Model Development: Build and evaluate predictive models using time-series and statistical techniques.

Visualization: Create visualizations to present insights and trends.

Insights & Predictions: Deliver actionable predictions for stakeholders during live elections.
